## GMRES

Welcome to the project "Parallel Preconditioned GMRES"! The project intends to solve a 3D poisson's equation by the generalized minimal residual method (GMRES) in parallel. So far a sequential algorithm of GMRES has just been developed. The program structure follows the idea of the [homework](https://gitlab.tudelft.nl/dhpc/sticse-hpc/homework1) of the course WI4450 held by Jonas and Martin from TU Delft.
